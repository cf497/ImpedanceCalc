# ImpedanceCalc
Python script to compute the impedance of a nanocapacitor from the timeseries of electrode charge in a constant potential simulation. Requires an outfile containing the electrode charge timeseries, alongside editing of the system parameter variables in the script. This script outputs both the admittance and impedance as a function of frequency.
